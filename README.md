## Introduction

The OpenAI library is a powerful tool for integrating OpenAI's language models into your Python applications. With this library, you can leverage the capabilities of advanced models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 to build intelligent chatbots, content generators, and more.

This tutorial repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide on using the OpenAI library effectively. It covers various aspects, including setting up the environment, making API calls, handling responses, and implementing advanced techniques like output validation and content filtering.

## Requirements

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- Python 3.10 or higher. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org)
- An OpenAI API key. Sign up for an API key at [openai.com](https://www.openai.com)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/daveebbelaar/openai-python-tutorial.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd openai-python-tutorial
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## OpenAI API Models

The OpenAI API provides access to a diverse set of language models with different capabilities and price points. This tutorial covers working with models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. You can also explore fine-tuning options to customize the models for your specific use case.
